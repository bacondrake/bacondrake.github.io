<h3 id="about" class="anchor">About</h3>
<p>The <a href="pages/about.html">about</a> page is your standard obligatory about page</p>

<h3 id="programming-tools" class="anchor">Programming tools</h3>
<p>The <a href="pages/programming-tools.html">programming tools</a> page has a bunch of programming tools I've come across. Some of them will have notes on my personal experiences and general thoughts, particularly tutorials. A lot of them are just there for my reference later on.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="dictionary" class="anchor">Dictionary</h3>
<p>The <a href="pages/dictionary.html">dictionary</a> just has a bunch of encountered words and their meanings. I've put them there for my reference â€” if I hear a word that I think will be useful later on, I will probably put it in there because I'll forget it otherwise. Then the definition is there forevermore.</p>
