<p>This is the dictionary page. It has definitions of various words - there is no logic to what the words are.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Extol</dt>
  <dd>To praise highly, glorify.<br/>
    Pretty sure I read this in an article. Someone was being extolled, which I thought sounded bad at the time, but it's good.</dd>
  <dt>Subcutaneous</dt>
  <dd><em>Medical</em>: Under the skin. Being, living, occurring, or administered under the skin.<br/>
    Motorola reportedly created a password pill. Someone assumed it would be subcutaneous but apparently you eat it.</dd>
  <dt>Dearth</dt>
  <dd>The state or condition of not having enough of something. Scarcity, an inadequate supply.<br/>
    I think this was in the Game of Thrones book. It seems fitting.</dd>
  <dt>Bespoke</dt>
  <dd>Made to fit a particular person; custom made.<br/>
    Someone said they were going to make a bespoke PC that only played Mario Kart.</dd>
  <dt>Ablution</dt>
  <dd>The washing of one's body or part of it (as in a religious rite). The act or action of bathing.<br/>
    I read this one in a news article written by a cranky sounding man. It was used facetiously.</dd>
