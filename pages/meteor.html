<h4>Install and learn Meteor, the Javascript framework</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.meteor.com/install" target="_blank">https://www.meteor.com/install</a></p>

<p>This tutorial was very well put together. It takes you through the basic functions of Meteor and provides further reading to help you put together your own application on the framework. Each section is not overly long but still explains in appropriate detail what is happening with each piece of code you write.</p>

<p>There is a Javascript and HTML pre-requisite, but you can complete the tutorial without knowing either - you just may not learn much, if anything, because of the steep curve.</p>

<p>I'm not sure when the tutorial was written. It seems recent, but the CSS they give you seems quite dated. This doesn't matter as far as functionality goes, but the first thing I would do if continuing a project following from this tutorial would be to change the design. Other than the CSS, the tutorial is great. It's easy to follow, simple and informative and does not require a great amount of energy to get done, as some tutorials do.</p>
