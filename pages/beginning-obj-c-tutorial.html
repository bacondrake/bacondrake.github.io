<h4>Learn to code iOS Apps 1: Welcome to Programming</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/38557/learn-to-code-ios-apps-1-welcome-to-programming" target="_blank">http://www.raywenderlich.com/38557/learn-to-code-ios-apps-1-welcome-to-programming</a></p>

<p>This tutorial is the first part of a four parter beginner's guide to Objective-C. It starts from the basics of programming, but it was good to go back to the basics here because a decent set of material was covered in a short time, plus some of the more difficult looking parts of Objective-C were introduced.</p>
<p>This first part just focused on a simple command line random number guessing game. Its positives were that it was quick and easy to get into the material and get the little game going, while covering programming basics like variables, types and loops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the site is not updating tutorials on Obj-C, and has not done so since iOS 6, because they have shifted focus to Swift. This part did not run into any code update errors, and I ran it from the iOS 8 version. Everything covered was very basic - aimed at programming beginners.</p>
<p>Quick and easy, but very basic.</p>

<h4>Learn to Code iOS Apps 2: Strings, Arrays, Objects and Classes</h4>

<p>I liked this part better than part 1. It's by the same guy and it is still written for iOS6 (I'm running it for iOS8), but so far there have only been a couple of differences, and none of them in the code itself.</p>
<p>What it covered is written in the title. I enjoyed it so much because I've gotten a good handle on objects, classes and arrays from formally learning Java. Objective-C deals with them differently, but the background behind what they do is the same. Because of this I was able to focus on some of the unfamiliar Objective-C syntax. It took me longer than I'm proud to admit to realise Objective-C doesn't use dot notation.</p>
<p>Not overly difficult, but a good next step in the learning Objective-C process.</p>
